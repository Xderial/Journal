# Journal

*Working title*

A diary or journal like program, which can also be used for very quick note taking. Journal is designed to allow you to quickly add new entries without having to go through menus, or setting anything up.

To make a new entry, launch journalentry.pyw. The program will automatically set the date and time of your entry. An optional title can be added, as well as tags to help searching later.

The entry viewer, journal.pyw, let's you search and preview all your entries. Double clicking an entry opens it up in edit mode. Pressing the `Delete` key deletes the selected entry.
